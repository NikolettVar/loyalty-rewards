This small project was created as part of a Continuous Assessment.

An airline company has an application for their loyalty cards programme to 
determine the miles earned by a customer based on the flight ticket price. The 
application prompts the user to enter the customerâ€™s loyalty card status, the number 
of flights the customer flew with the company during the current year, and the flight 
ticket price. Next, the application computes the miles earned by the customer 
according to pre-set rules.
Loyalty card status | Number of flights the user flew in the current year | Miles Earned
bronze                  Between 1 and 4 inclusive                           3 * ticket price;
                        5 or more                                           4 * ticket price;
silver                  Between 1 and 4 inclusive                           5 * ticket price;
                        5 or more                                           6 * ticket price;
gold                    Between 1 and 4 inclusive                           7 * ticket price;
                        5 or more                                           8 * ticket price.
This application makes use of instantiable classes and nested if statements.
